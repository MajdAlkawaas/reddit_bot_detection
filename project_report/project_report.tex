\section{Introduction}

On social media, bot accounts are everywhere. Bot accounts are prob-
lematic as they have to ability to manipulate information, spread misinforma-
tion, and promote unverified information, which can adversely affect public

opinion on various topics, such as products and political campaigns.
However, as many bots are trying the hard way to avoid being detected,
bot detection activity requires complex analysis and training.
